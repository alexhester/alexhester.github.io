                I made this boost converter circuit to boost 3.0V - 4.2V LiPo batteries to between 3.7V and 15.2V at high currents.
                It is built around the UC3843AN pwm controller.
                The UC3843 requires 8.4V to 30V to operate so I have an additional MT3608 boost converter onboard to supply 9V to VCC.
                The PDP6902 N-Mosfet, HS060H006 schottky diode, and 400 uH inductor were salvaged from damaged ATX computer power supplies.
                I made a custom 0.1 Ohm wire-wound resistor connected to the UC3843's current sense input to limit the current to ~10 amps.
                I used values for of 5.1 kOhm for Rt and 730pF for Ct to produce a frequency of around 300 kHz for the UC3843.
                My converter lacked a soft-start circuit which caused issues if I had multiple high current LiPo batteries in parallel connected to the input.
                I solved this by creating an external soft-start circuit and writing some code. This soft-start circuit consists of a 0.3 Ohm power resistor and another PDP6902 N-Mosfet, and is connected in between the converter and ground.
                When power is first turned on, the converters input current is limited by the power resistor, and after a one second delay, my microcontroller sends power to the mosfet's gate to short the resistor, allowing higher current to flow.
