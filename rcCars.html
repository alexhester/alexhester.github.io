                I built this car because I wanted a fast RC car.
                The others used Lego motors and were not fast.
                I ordered a powerful motor for this one.
                It draws a lot of current, so I needed to create a heavy duty H-Bridge motor controller to drive it.
                I salvaged 4 high current N-E-Mosfets and Schottky rectifier diodes from ATX power supplies to create the H-Bridge.
                This one is controlled with an ESP32.
                I also modelled and 3d printed a transmission.
                Its has low, high, and neutral gears.
                Any bluetooth controller can connect to the ESP32 to control the car.

                This RC car was built for a group project at York Technical College.
                I found it in my grandma's attic when we were cleaning it out, and wanted to fix it up.
                It is a 57 Chevy that was made in 1986.
                It had a wired controller, and the batteries were extremely corroded.
                The purpose of the project was to restore the car and convert it to wireless.
                We added a light sensor and front and rear obstacle avoidance sensors, and replaced the rear motor with a Lego motor.
                The original motor still worked, but did not have the torque to move all the added weight.
                The light sensor allows the headlights to automatically turn on in darkness.
                We also added four LiPo batteries for a total capacity of 13515mAh, and a USB-C port for charging.
                The car is controlled with a Raspberry Pi 2B that runs a <a href="https://github.com/alexhester/RC-Cars/blob/main/57Chevy.py">Python script</a> on boot.
                We also replaced the wheels, since the old ones were dry rotted.
                The motors are powered by an L298N motor driver.
                There are some issues with this one, like that the infrared obstacle avoidance sensors are susceptible to interference from the sun,
                    and that the Lego motor is pretty slow.
                The project report is available <a href="https://github.com/alexhester/RC-Cars/blob/main/57%20Chevy%20Pics/Project%20Report.pdf">here</a>.

                I built this car very quickly over a weekend, to donate to York Tech.
                They wanted to keep the 57 Chevy, but I wouldn't let them for sentimental reasons.
                This one is using 3D printed body panels of a 1998 Firebird that I modeled in Blender.
                It is using Lego motors for both driving and steering, and the whole drivetrain is built from Legos.
                I added more obstacle avoidance sensors for better detection,
                    but they are the same sensors as the 57 Chevy so they still suffer from interference in the sunlight.
                I made the steel frame from an old computer case.
                This one is using a Raspberry Pi 1, and the <a href="https://github.com/alexhester/RC-Cars/blob/main/Firebird.py">Python script</a>
                    is very similar to the 57 Chevy's script, with a few changes for the extra sensors, different GPIO pins, etc.
                The project report is available <a href="https://github.com/alexhester/RC-Cars/blob/main/Firebird%20Pics/Donation%20Report.pdf" >here</a>.
